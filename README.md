Knock Knock is a face recognition SMS security application that gives a home owner information about guests at the front door. Program makes use of Twilio SMS API, Ngrok and Microsoft AZURE Face API. Once a person is detected a camera takes a picture of the person and checks whether the person is present in a local databse and sends the image along with the person's name (if present) to the home owner. The home owner can then decide whether to allow the person to enter.

Use Readme.txt for temporary instructions on how to use this application.
