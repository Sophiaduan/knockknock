Knock Knock is a face recognition SMS security application that gives a home owner information about guests at the front door. Program makes use of Twilio SMS API, Ngrok and Microsoft AZURE Face API. Once a person is detected a camera takes a picture of the person and checks whether the person is present in a local databse and sends the image along with the person's name (if present) to the home owner. The home owner can then decide whether to allow the person to enter.
